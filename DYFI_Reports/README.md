# Explanation of Codes 
DYFI MAP is largely used to create a DYFI map ;)
Relies on an iput geojson file that GA produces. These codes have been based off trevor allen, and relies on importing some of his custom python files. Can change the earthquake by change DYFI_MAP.py file under earthquake event.
